The goal of this app is to prototype an actual app, so keep the interactions simple and don't wire things up unless instructed.

Always use the @companycam/slab-web import for UI components. If you can't find a component in @companycam/slab-web, it's ok to import another package for that component. Import react-select if you need a select/autocomplete.

Always use the CSS variables import from @companycam/slab-tokens to add color. The "light-environment" and "dark-environment" CSS classes allow you to switch between light and dark UIs.

Always use the https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mdi/font@7.1.96/css/materialdesignicons.min.css import for icons. For example: <i className="mdi mdi-pencil" />.

Thank you.
